SQL
===

This is more just a showcase for writing code than anything else:

.. code-block:: sql

    -- Example SQL queries
    -- Select all columns from a table
    SELECT *
    FROM my_table;

    -- Select specific columns with a condition
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM my_table
    WHERE condition;

    -- Update statement
    UPDATE my_table
    SET column1 = value1
    WHERE condition;

    -- Insert statement
    INSERT INTO my_table (column1, column2)
    VALUES (value1, value2);

    -- Delete statement
    DELETE FROM my_table
    WHERE condition;
